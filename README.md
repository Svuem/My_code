Hi! This is some code that I've worked on. The "analyse" code was written by Christian Henningsen and myself. It mainly features plotting, curve fitting, and some rudimentary error analysis.
I want to build up this repo with snippets that aren't full self-contained projects, but have some useful code that I might want to use for different projects in the future.
